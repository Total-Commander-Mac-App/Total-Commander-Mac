## 🧩 Overview  

Total Commander for macOS is an advanced, dual-pane file management tool that brings power, precision, and flexibility to users who need more than what the default Finder offers. Designed for efficiency, it provides a structured environment for handling files, archives, and directories — perfect for professionals and enthusiasts managing large or complex data sets.  

The hallmark of Total Commander is its split-panel interface, allowing two folders to be viewed and operated simultaneously. This layout makes file transfers, comparisons, and synchronizations exceptionally fast and intuitive. Combined with its keyboard-driven navigation and highly customizable shortcuts, it delivers a level of control unmatched by traditional file managers.  

Beyond standard file operations like copy, move, and rename, Total Commander integrates advanced tools for compression, decompression, and content comparison. It supports a vast range of archive formats — including ZIP, RAR, 7Z, and TAR — and even lets you browse archive contents without extraction. Remote file handling is just as easy, thanks to built-in FTP, FTPS, and SFTP clients that make server management seamless.  

For users who rely on efficiency, Total Commander’s batch renaming and synchronization utilities are indispensable. Its robust search engine can locate files by name, type, or content instantly, while checksum and version comparison tools ensure data integrity. Power users can extend functionality further through plug-ins, adding capabilities like media previews, custom scripts, or automation modules.  

Designed with macOS compatibility in mind, the app runs smoothly on both Intel and Apple Silicon systems, delivering exceptional stability and speed. Total Commander’s minimalist yet powerful interface ensures that every feature is accessible without clutter, letting you focus entirely on productivity.  

Whether you’re maintaining a local file system, organizing backups, or managing multiple servers, Total Commander offers a complete, reliable, and efficient workflow tailored for macOS professionals.
